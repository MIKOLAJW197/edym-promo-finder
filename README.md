# Edym-promo-finder

Simple node.js script to find PROMO product on  [E-dym.pl](https://e-dym.pl).
In 'links.txt' I pasted category links - but I dont know if it is enough.

## Getting Started

To start app:

```
git clone https://github.com/MIKOLAJW197/edym-promo-finder.git
npm install
npm start
```

### How it work

It call all links from 'links.txt' and look for product with price 0.01. (0,01 z≈Ç)
It will scrape all sites, every minute and will display only fresh links. (links that wasn't found on last search)
